# bot-typist README

This is a simple VS Code extension that lets you chat with an AI Bot (such as GPT-4) while editing a text file.

Type 'bot:' and select the 'Talk to Bot' autocomplete to insert a bot response.

## Features

Currently supports plain text or markdown files; more to come.

## Requirements

The extension runs [Simon Willison's llm command](https://llm.datasette.io/), which you must install separately. You can configure the LLM command to use whichever AI chat you prefer.

## Extension Settings

- `bot-typist.llm.path` the path to the LLM command to run.

## Known Issues

It works on my machine, but this is an early pre-release, so there will likely be bugs.

## Release Notes

Not released yet.
